     <p>Hey ! I'm <strong>Nefertari</strong>.<br/></p>
    <p>Coding is changing my world. It's not just about earning money and get a better job.</p>
    <p>Learning to code give me problem-solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical and a higher level. But, the most important I'll be also able to develop websites and to use my coding skills to work on projects which are concerned with the human right</p>
     <p>Deeply, I want to become an active part of the change I want to see in my country side, French Guiana, in South America. And so on, I'm glad I've found the opportunity to learn coding with SoloLearn.</p>
