I'm here to learn coding as I want to be a part of the change I want to see around me, especially in my countryside, French Guiana. I attend coding courses with Simplon, I'm glad they offer me a computer, I can work easier. I understand I'm the best one to satisfy my needs and so on, I'm able to find the best resources to masterize the journey.
